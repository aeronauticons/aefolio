Acknowledging the difficulties of teaching mathematics online, this project aims to simplify the process for educators, particularly those at the college level. Created by a team of two developers, QuBE encompasses a variety of functionalities designed to enhance the teaching experience.<br/><br/>
      The main purpose of the app is the interactive whiteboard area, which includes essential tools such as adjustable pen sizes, color selections, shapes, and erasers. These features helps educators to present mathematical concepts clearly and creatively. Additionally, QuBE allows for the instant plotting of formulas, planes, and graphs, providing a visualization tool.<br/><br/>
      Following that, the app also includes different sections for generating various mathematical tables, which are exclusively for college-level math topics. These table generation tools help streamline lesson preparation, allowing educators to focus more on engaging with their students.<br/><br/>
      The QuBE app has been recognized as the best thesis project among all computer science presentations in our batch, highlighting its significance in transforming mathematics education in an online learning environment.`,
